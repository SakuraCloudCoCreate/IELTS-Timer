## Background of this Project
First of all, I am a student who took part in the IELTS Examination as well. However, I found that there are fewer tools online to help IELTS takers become more familiar with the IELTS exam, especially for the paper-based version. During the two times I took the IELTS, I realized the need to create a tool for those who want to engage in the paper-based IELTS exams. Because I know the process and policy of the IELTS exams, I decided to create this tool for you, and I hope you will enjoy it.
